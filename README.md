# An InfoVis tool for component-based evaluation

An InfoVis tool based on Sankey diagrams for the exploration of large combinatorial combinations of IR components â€“ the Grid of Points (GoP) (http://gridofpoints.dei.unipd.it/ and https://github.com/gridofpoints). The goal of this tool is to ease the comprehension of the behavior of single IR components within fully functioning off-the-shelf IR systems without recurring to complex statistical tools. The tool is available at the following URL: http://gridofpoints.dei.unipd.it/sankey/.
